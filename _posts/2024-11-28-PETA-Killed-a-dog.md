PETA employees stole a crying little girls dog from her porch and euthenised it because they don't believe in owning pets and then later got fined for stealing and killing her dog

# The boring and mostly neutral reality

a trailer park owner called PETA to take in a bunch of local stray dogs in the trailer park, they saw the girls dog (that had no collar or identification), that dog was freely roaming the park (even though the family had repeatedly been told to not let it), the peta workers went to grab it at which point it ran back to a poarch, they then took it and one worker euthanised it (without the mandatory 5 day waiting period), PETA said sorry to the family, paid a fine for not waiting the madatory period and fired that worker.

Should peta have waited? yes. Was this petas fault? No it was a single employee not following guidelines and a family letting thier dog that has no id roam a trailer park (after being told not to) knowing there are a bunch of stray dogs that're soon going to be rounded up - it was a stupid employee and irresponsible pet owners
