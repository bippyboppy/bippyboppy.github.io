> You will tread on the asp and the basilisk, and you will trample the lion and the dragon underfoot. -  Psalm 91:13

This can largely be thought of as a continuation of my earlier blog post[^1] explaining why rokos basilisk is absolutely worthless trash and anyone who takes it seriously should feel embarassed. In this I want to lay out pretty clearly a basilisk that is possibly already causing you harm and going forward the risk will likely increase, I used the psalms quote above to illustrate that it can also offer benefits.
