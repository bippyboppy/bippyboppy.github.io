I want to stress reading a lot is very much just consistency*time - the average book take 3-7 hours to read, if you read for 15 minutes when you wake up and 15 minutes before bed everyday for a year you'll read between 25-50 books per year, it's just consistency however as someone who reads a lot the fetishisation of reading is really dumb, generally books have low information density, high cost (in terms of money and time), I read because I enjoy it but unless you really enjoy reading you're better off learning from blog posts and youtube videos.
