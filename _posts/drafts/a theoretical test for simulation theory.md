 <!-- truncate -->

This is not meant to be a definite test it's more of an indication that people should be able to replicate the underlying logic is

1. If the universe is a simulation it will have a mixture of simulated/non-simulated beings
2. If you know you have internal thoughts you know you're non simulated (though you can never know if others are)
3. If a non-simulated user goes to an area on a regular basis additional resources should be allocated to that area (more simulated people)
4. If you go to a new area at the same time each day for 14 days it should roughly follow a weekly pattern (but if simulation theory is true it will likely just increase)
   1. The more new areas you go to that this replicates to the lower the chance of coincidence or confounding factors

## Log

Since the duration and time of day is static for each location I've removed it to stop the table being too bloated.
