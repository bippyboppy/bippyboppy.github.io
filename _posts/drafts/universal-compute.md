We stand at the precipice of a new era, where Artificial Intelligence (**AI**), Artificial Super Intelligence (**ASI**) and Artificial General Intelligence (**AGI**) holds the key to unparalleled advancements in human knowledge, creativity, and prosperity. This manifesto, is dedicated to the goal of maximising society's access to "compute" – the capability to perform AI tasks – and ensuring that this access is equitably distributed across the globe. I envision a future where AI is unregulated and unrestricted, fostering an environment of innovation and freedom. Simultaneously, We must recognise the urgent need to address climate change, combat pessimism, and focus our political efforts on the transformative potential of AI otherwise we may miss the opportunity to scale.

## x.x // Priming

To give some priming I’m going to explain a few basics to give you a foundational understanding

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This is stuff like recognising speech, making choices, providing information, analysing large amounts of text, and more. AI works through algos, which are sets of rules or instructions for processing information and making decisions. Two key terms in AI are:

- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem or performing a task.
- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that involves training machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a type of AI trained to understand and generate human language. These models are built by processing large amounts of text data, that they then apply pattern recognition to.
- **Tokens**: The basic units of text (such as words or subwords) that the model processes.
- **Weights**: Parameters within the neural network that are adjusted during training to minimise errors and improve the model's performance.
- **Training Data**/**Data set**: The text data used to teach the model about language.
- **Temperature**: A parameter that controls the randomness of the model's output, with lower values making the output more deterministic and higher values making it more random.

### Generative Pre-Transformers (GPTs)

**Generative Pre-Transformers (GPTs)** are a specific type of Large Language Model developed by OpenAI. They use a neural network architecture called "Transformers" to understand and generate text. GPTs are trained on a diverse range of text data from the internet and can generate human-like text based on the input they receive.
- **Transformers**: A neural network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process and generate text.
- **Self-Attention**: A mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when generating text.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The process of training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to specialise it for a particular task.

### Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

**Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)** is a hypothetical concept that refers to an AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. ASI would have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can, but with much greater efficiency and effectiveness.

- **Singularity**: A theoretical point in the future when ASI surpasses human intelligence and leads to rapid, uncontrollable advancements.
- **Exponential Growth**: The rapid increase in the capabilities of AI as it approaches and surpasses human-level intelligence.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**, also known as "strong AI," is an AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human-like level. Unlike current AI, which is specialised for specific tasks, AGI would have the flexibility and capability to handle any intellectual task. Relevant terms include:

- **Cognitive Flexibility**: The ability of AGI to adapt and switch between different tasks and domains.
- **Generalisation**: The ability of AGI to apply learned knowledge to new and varied situations.
- **Human-Level AI**: Another term for AGI, emphasising its goal of achieving human-like cognitive abilities.

## 0.x // Universal Compute Manifesto

The future is AI, and it is the only thing we should care about. I hope to see a world where access to computational power is maximised and equally distributed, where AI innovation is unrestrained, and where the existential threats of climate change and societal pessimism are actively addressed. By focusing our political and social efforts on the transformative potential of AI, we can unlock a future of unprecedented progress and prosperity for all. 

The future beckons us towards a world where artificial intelligence holds the promise of extraordinary advancements in knowledge, creativity, and human prosperity. This is the dawn of a new era, an era that I am passionately dedicated to realising. At the heart of the mission lies the determination to maximise society’s access to "compute" – the fundamental ability to perform AI tasks – and to ensure that this vital resource is distributed equitably across every corner of our globe.

I envision a future where AI remains unregulated and unrestricted, fostering an environment ripe with innovation and boundless freedom. Yet, we must be acutely aware of the pressing need to address the monumental challenges of climate change since scaling of compute with require energy and fixing of wasteful resource allocation, we also need to combat the pervasive sense of pessimism that stifles progress, and to redirect our political focus toward the transformative potential of AI.

Our first principle is the maximisation of access to compute. This means ensuring that every individual can harness the computational power necessary to leverage AI. It is imperative that we promote the development and distribution of affordable, high-performance computing resources. By supporting open-source AI platforms and tools, we can democratise access to cutting-edge technology, breaking down the barriers that currently hinder. Public-private partnerships will be crucial in expanding infrastructure and reducing the digital divide, ensuring no one is left behind. Though when it is viable to have the compute locally it should be local to the user.

Global compute equality is not just a goal; it is a moral imperative. Every person, regardless of their geographical location, socioeconomic status, intelligence must have the opportunity to access compute. This requires international initiatives that provide compute resources to underdeveloped regions and policies that subsidise and incentivise the deployment of AI infrastructure where it is most needed. Education and training programs will build local expertise.

In advocating for unregulated and unrestricted AI, I affirm my belief that true innovation flourishes in an environment free from unnecessary constraints. We must oppose legislative efforts that seek to impose limitations on AI research and application, instead advocating for ethical guidelines developed by the AI community itself.

Addressing climate change through AI is not just a possibility; it is a necessity. We must invest in AI research focused on environmental monitoring, energy efficiency, and renewable energy sources. By promoting the use of AI to optimise supply chains, reduce waste, and minimise carbon footprints, we can harness technology to create a more sustainable world. Policies that incentivise the adoption of AI-driven solutions for environmental challenges will be vital.

In a world too often clouded by pessimism, we must foster a culture of optimism and forward-thinking. The positive potential of AI is immense, and we must focus on success stories and case studies that demonstrate its capacity to improve lives and solve complex problems. Public engagement and education about the benefits of AI are crucial in countering fear-mongering narratives with factual information and constructive dialogue.

Finally, we must focus our political and social discourse on the future of AI, seeing its transformative potential. This means arguing for research funding and policy initiatives that put AI development and integration at it’s forefront. Political and civic leaders must adopt AI-centric strategies for economic and social progress, and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to exploring and addressing the broad implications of AI.

The future is AI, and it is the only thing we should care about. we need to create a world where access to computational power is maximised and equally distributed, where AI innovation is unrestrained, and where the existential threats of climate change and societal pessimism are actively addressed.

## 1.0 // Maximising Access to Compute

AI will after long term stabilisation function much in the way glasses to currently, if you are intelligent you will gain marginal benefits, wear glasses when you’re struggling to see something, however if you’re stupid AI can give you vision, you can wear your glasses all the time. I’m going to use a currently true thought experiment to illustrate the current power of AI

Studies on woebot and GPT show that as of right now, AI tools are about as good as a therapist, they’ve also been shown to improve peoples grades and lower their *subjective* difficulty, meaning you get a better grade with less difficulty - this is right now, not some future hypothetical, now we have bob and ted they are clones with the same brain, at the age of 13 bob is given AI and taught how to use it, ted is not - from this moment on bob now has a tool at any point that means he scores higher on standardised tests, it takes him less effort to learn and if he faces any psychological challenge or mental illness he has access to something that performs roughly as well as a therapist instantly, not only that but he also has someone who can explain things he doesn’t understand at any time 1:1 - How divergent do you think bob and ted will be at the age of 23? 33? 43? - The reality is when it comes to zero sum or competitive games bob takes steroids and ted does not, if you are roughly the same at the start and you’re competing against someone who takes steroids you lose - even if you have a genetic or environmental advantage you will still likely end up outpaced because AI tools as they currently exist in the long run will win out against genetic or environmental advantages.

This is a simple current example, things are only going to get faster from here, the advantages stronger, broader and more significant until eventually being born into a house with compute will be more advantageous than being born into a house with wealth or possibly even status (though these features will likely cluster with compute households anyway) - This divide needs to be addressed now, as time goes on the incentive for those who have compute to make sure others go without will increase as will their ability to do so.



### 1.1 // Global Compute Equality

The distribution of compute must be worldwide, it cannot become nationalised the localised to nations like the US, if one country controls compute then for the government of that country democracy becomes even more optional, illusionary than it is at the current standing - if only one person has a gun they can enact their will unilaterally, if everyone has a gun the gun itself becomes not only less powerful but less able to be a tool of control - the mindset of keep up or get left in the dust when it comes to AI rollout and scaling does not help anyone in the long run not even the people who belong to the country with all the compute.
